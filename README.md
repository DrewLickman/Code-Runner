# Code Runner

Code Runner is a single-player two-dimensional platformer video game. The original idea of the game was inspired by the Youtube series “Animator vs. Animation”. The concept is now the player acts as a hacker to get into the deeper levels of the computer’s files. As the player progresses through the game, they encounter hazards and enemies, and must parkour and fight to reach the next stage. Our team wanted to implement many unique ideas of thematic levels, enemy types, weapons, tools, and bosses, but we realized there would not be enough time in the semester to finish our dream game. We had to significantly restrict the scope of our project, not only due to the remaining time, but also because we all had a heavy workload of school, work, and personal matters to attend to.
