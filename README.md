The player will navigate through a 2d Windows desktop environment. The player's goal is to collect resources and reach the goal. The player will have access to a cheats menu and a toolbar full of unique computer / hacker themed abilities. The cheats and tools will cost resources which can be found and collected throughout the levels. Collected resources can later be used to upgrade the tech tree to unlock more cheats, tools, and general progression. There will be obstacles, enemies, and an environmental anti-virus scanning hazard. The player can reach the end of the game after defeating the final boss. 
Post-game includes revisiting levels to attempt finishing the levels creatively without using resources so that they can keep all the resources.
