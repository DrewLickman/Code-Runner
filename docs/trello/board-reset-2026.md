# Trello board reset (keep design only)

Goal: **keep game design ideas/plans**, ignore old execution/WIP/scrapped tracking.

## Recommended approach: duplicate + prune (minimal risk)

1. In Trello, open your board: `main`.
2. **Duplicate** the board.
   - Name: `Code Runner 2026`
   - Keep cards: ✅ (yes)
3. In `Code Runner 2026`, **archive/delete these lists** (you said to ignore WIP/scrapped):
   - `To Do`
   - `Doing`
   - `Testing`
   - `Polishing`
   - `Bugs`
   - `Done 🎉`
   - `Scrapped💀`
4. In `Code Runner 2026`, keep only the two design lists and optionally rename them:
   - `Backlog` → `Design Ideas`
   - `Design` → `Design Specs`
5. (Optional) Archive the two template explainer cards (they’re not your design work):
   - `Backlog / Ideas`
   - `Design & Research`

## Alternative: create a fresh board and copy only design cards

If you want a totally clean slate, create a new board and copy only the cards listed in [`docs/trello/design-salvage.md`](docs/trello/design-salvage.md).

Suggested 2026 list layout:

- `Design Inbox` (raw ideas)
- `Design Spec` (written + decision-ready)
- `Next Slice` (top 5 things for the next playable milestone)
- `Icebox` (good ideas, not now)
